    	Happy New Year !!!
    </div><br/>
   	<pre>
    	No more champagne
        And the fireworks are through
        Here we are, me and you
        Feeling lost and feeling blue
        It's the end of the party
        And the morning seems so grey
        So unlike yesterday
        Now's the time for us to say...
        
        Happy new year
        Happy new year
        May we all have a vision now and then
        Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
        Happy new year
        Happy new year
        May we all have our hopes, our will to try
        If we don't we might as well lay down and die
        You and I
        
        Sometimes I see
        How the brave new world arrives
        And I see how it thrives
        In the ashes of our lives
        Oh yes, man is a fool
        And he thinks he'll be okay
        Dragging on, feet of clay
        Never knowing he's astray
        Keeps on going anyway...
        
        Happy new year
        Happy new year
        May we all have a vision now and then
        Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
        Happy new year
        Happy new year
        May we all have our hopes, our will to try
        If we don't we might as well lay down and die
        You and I
        
        Seems to me now
        That the dreams we had before
        Are all dead, nothing more
        Than confetti on the floor
        It's the end of a decade
        In another ten years time
        Who can say what we'll find
        What lies waiting down the line
        In the end of eighty-nine...
        
        Happy new year
        Happy new year
        May we all have a vision now and then
        Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
        Happy new year
        Happy new year
        May we all have our hopes, our will to try
        If we don't we might as well lay down and die
        You and I
